  üöß X-Launcher is still experimental and has not been thoroughly tested. üöß
</p>

üí° **TL;DR**: X-Launcher is a simple binary `x` which, when executed, scans for an `xfile` starting in the invocation directory and working its way up. When it finds an `xfile`, it uses it to launch project-specific tooling either (a) by executing the `xfile` itself or (b) delegating to a third-party tool (e.g., `cargo`, `make`, or `npm`).

ü§î **Rationale**: X-Launcher provides consistency across projects using different tools and languages by making `x` the universal command to interact with whatever tooling is required to work on a project. In addition, it makes it very easy to add custom freeform tooling in the form of an `xfile` script (e.g., Bash or Python).

Checkout the [examples](https://github.com/silitics/x-launcher/tree/main/examples) to get an idea what X-Launcher can do for you. X-Launcher is designed to work with any tool. Just to name a few examples, X-Launcher works well with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [just](https://just.systems/), and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).


## Installation

Currently, the official way to install X-Launcher is via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```
cargo install x-launcher
```


## Usage

Simply run `x`. All arguments are forwarded to the underlying tool.


## `xfile` Reference

An `xfile` is interpreted in one of two ways:

- If the `xfile` starts with a [Unix shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)), then the `xfile` itself is executed. On Unix-like systems, this is done simply by executing the `xfile` itself. On Windows, `x` takes care of parsing the shebang and executing the correct program with the `xfile` as an argument. To this end, if the shebang starts with a path, other than `/usr/bin/env`, the binary name is looked up using the environment's `PATH` variable. If the shebang starts with `/usr/bin/env` the first argument of `env` is used to lookup the executable.

- If the `xfile` does not start with a shebang, then it must have the form `!command` or `>command` where `command` is interpreted as a [POSIX shell command](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html) (currently without performing any expansions, e.g., of variables or `~`). X-Launcher will execute the specified command in the invocation directory, for `!command`, or in the directory of the `xfile`, for `>command`. In the latter case, the environment variable `X_INVOCATION_DIR` is set to the invocation directory such that it can still be retrieved.

In any case, arguments passed to `x` are forwarded to whatever is launched.

Note that in both cases, at least on Unix-like systems, the use of X-Launcher is entirely optional. In case of an `xfile` script with a shebang, the script can still be launched manually, and in case of a command, the command can be directly executed without going through `x`. Hence, X-Launcher is just a convenience.


## Contributing

We do accept bug fixes and improvements, and are open to [discuss ideas](https://github.com/silitics/x-launcher/discussions/categories/ideas). However, note that X-Launcher is intentionally kept very simple. There are already many great tools out there solving different project automation needs. X-Launcher is, as the name suggests, just a launcher and does not aim be more. Hence, we will likely reject any contributions extending X-Launcher beyond the purpose of launching.
